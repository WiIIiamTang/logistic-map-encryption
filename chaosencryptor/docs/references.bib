    abstract = {In recent years, the chaos based cryptographic algorithms have suggested some new and efficient ways to develop secure image encryption techniques. In this communication, we propose a new approach for image encryption based on chaotic logistic maps in order to meet the requirements of the secure image transfer. In the proposed image encryption scheme, an external secret key of 80-bit and two chaotic logistic maps are employed. The initial conditions for the both logistic maps are derived using the external secret key by providing different weightage to all its bits. Further, in the proposed encryption process, eight different types of operations are used to encrypt the pixels of an image and which one of them will be used for a particular pixel is decided by the outcome of the logistic map. To make the cipher more robust against any attack, the secret key is modified after encrypting each block of sixteen pixels of the image. The results of several experimental, statistical analysis and key sensitivity tests show that the proposed image encryption scheme provides an efficient and secure way for real-time image encryption and transmission.}

    title = {A Chaotic Cryptosystem for Images Based on Henon and Arnold Cat Map},
    abstract = {AB  - The rapid evolution of imaging and communication technologies has transformed images into a widespread data type. Different types of data, such as personal medical information, official correspondence, or governmental and military documents, are saved and transmitted in the form of images over public networks. Hence, a fast and secure cryptosystem is needed for high-resolution images. In this paper, a novel encryption scheme is presented for securing images based on Arnold cat and Henon chaotic maps. The scheme uses Arnold cat map for bit- and pixel-level permutations on plain and secret images, while Henon map creates secret images and specific parameters for the permutations. Both the encryption and decryption processes are explained, formulated, and graphically presented. The results of security analysis of five different images demonstrate the strength of the proposed cryptosystem against statistical, brute force and differential attacks. The evaluated running time for both encryption and decryption processes guarantee that the cryptosystem can work effectively in real-time applications.
