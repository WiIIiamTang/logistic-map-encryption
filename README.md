# Image encryption with the chaotic logistic map

Image encryption with XOR cipher, XOR cipher with Logistic Map, XOR cipher with Henon Map, and Logistic Map Pixel Iterations.


## Info
View the [webapp](https://logistic-map-326.herokuapp.com/) to try it out. 

**For more information on encryption tools and a standalone package for image encryption, go to ``chaosencryptor``, or [click this link](https://github.com/WiIIiamTang/logistic-map-encryption/tree/main/chaosencryptor).**

## Dev

To run the website,
```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

To run the server,
```sh
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python app.py
```

You can run both instances at the same time, but you need to set the ``api_base`` URL in ``EncryptDecryptMenu`` to the Flask server.

### Production
```sh
npm run dbuild
```
To build into the ``templates``. The site is served as a Flask app. 

The sample images need to be moved into wherever your static directory is (by default ``templates/static``).
